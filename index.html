      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold text-primary text-center mb-10 animate-fade-in">About Our Independent Support Service</h2>
      <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none mb-8 animate-fade-in" style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">
        <p>Hey there! We're a small but dedicated team of tech enthusiasts who started this service back in 2020 because we saw how many people were struggling with their SiriusXM setups. Picture this: one of our founders was on a cross-country drive when his radio suddenly went silent – no signal, no music, just frustration. That moment sparked the idea for a support service that's truly independent, focusing on practical, human-centered help without the corporate red tape.</p>
        <p>Over the years, we've grown by listening to real stories from users like you. We've helped busy parents fix app issues so their kids can listen to stories on long drives, assisted music lovers in optimizing their home setups for the best sound quality, and even guided seniors through account management with patience and clear explanations. Our approach is simple: treat every call like we're helping a friend.</p>
        <p>We believe in transparency – that's why we always remind you that we're not part of SiriusXM. We don't have insider access, but we do have a wealth of knowledge from troubleshooting thousands of cases. From signal tweaks that turn weak reception into strong vibes to billing tips that save you time and money, we're here to make your SiriusXM experience enjoyable again.</p>
        <p><strong>Important:</strong> This is an independent service. We are not part of SiriusXM, Sirius XM Holdings Inc., or any official SiriusXM entity. We do not have access to official SiriusXM systems and provide guidance based on publicly available information, common troubleshooting practices, and our collective expertise gathered from real-world scenarios.</p>
